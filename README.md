# Monolith: A lightweight 64-bit operating system

Plan:
- The OS shall have a monolithic kernel (as the name implies)
- The kernel shall do all important tasks (e.g. the filesystem, users, security)
- The OS shall be partially compatible with the NeOS project

To do:
- Implement a filesystem (e.g. FAT-32 or ext4)
